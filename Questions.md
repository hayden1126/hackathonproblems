### Coding Challenge: Ski Slope Difficulty Assessment

#### Objective
Develop a program that evaluates the difficulty of ski slopes by accounting for snowfall, snow slippage, and identifying the most challenging 50-meter segment. The difficulty is determined based on the steepness and bumpiness of this segment.

#### Requirements

1. **Input Data**:
   - `topography`: An array of integers representing the elevation at regular intervals along the slope.
   - `snowfall`: An array of floats indicating the expected snowfall at each point, matching the `topography` array in size.

2. **Snowfall Adjustment and Slippage**:
   - Increase each point's elevation in `topography` by the corresponding amount in `snowfall`.
   - Implement a slippage mechanism where, if the difference in elevation between adjacent points exceeds a predefined threshold, snow is redistributed until the difference is below the threshold. This simulates realistic snow behavior.

3. **Grade Calculation**:
   - **Steepness** (\(S\)): Calculate as the vertical drop divided by the horizontal distance, expressed as a percentage.
   - **Bumpiness** (\(B\)): Measure as the standard deviation of steepness within a segment, indicating terrain variability.
   - Divide the adjusted topography into overlapping 50-meter segments. For each segment, calculate \(S_{avg}\) (average steepness) and \(B\) (bumpiness).
   - Combine \(S_{avg}\) and \(B\) into a unified grade (\(G\)) for each segment using the formula: \(G = w_S \cdot S_{avg} + w_B \cdot B\), where \(w_S\) and \(w_B\) are the weights assigned to steepness and bumpiness, respectively.

4. **Output**:
   - Identify the segment with the highest unified grade (\(G\)) and present this as the slope's overall difficulty rating.

#### Implementation Details
- Ensure the program can handle arrays of varying lengths, with careful consideration for edge cases in snow slippage.
- Choose appropriate values for the threshold in slippage calculations and the weights (\(w_S\) and \(w_B\)) in the unified grade formula based on the desired emphasis on steepness vs. bumpiness.
- Validate input data for correctness and completeness.

#### Evaluation Criteria
- **Accuracy**: The program correctly accounts for snowfall and slippage and calculates the difficulty rating based on the hardest 50-meter segment.
- **Efficiency**: The implementation efficiently processes the input data, especially for larger arrays.
- **Robustness**: The program handles edge cases gracefully, including slopes with uniform elevation or extreme variations.

The starting point is the highest elevation and the ending point is the lowest, with varying elevations and snowfall amounts in between to simulate a realistic ski slope. The sample will include data for the `topography` array and the `snowfall` array, with the understanding that each index represents a regular interval along the slope.
You start from the left and end at the right.

### Sample Input

#### Topography Array (`topography`)
Represents the elevation at regular intervals along the slope:

```python
topography = [2200, 2150, 2100, 2075, 2050, 2025, 2000, 1980, 1950, 1900, 1850, 1800]
```

Here, the slope starts at an elevation of 2200 meters, decreasing to 1800 meters at the end, showcasing a gradual decline with minor fluctuations in elevation.

#### Snowfall Array (`snowfall`)
Indicates the expected snowfall in meters at each corresponding point on the topography map:

```python
snowfall = [0.5, 0.4, 0.6, 0.7, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.5, 0.4]
```

The snowfall varies at each point, affecting the slope's elevation and potentially its steepness and bumpiness after adjustment for slippage.

### Task Description

Using this input:
1. Adjust the `topography` array to account for the `snowfall`, increasing each elevation by the corresponding snowfall amount.
2. Implement the snow slippage mechanism to redistribute snow across adjacent points if the elevation difference exceeds a predefined threshold, ensuring a realistic adjustment of the slope's shape.
3. Divide the adjusted topography into overlapping 50-meter segments (assuming each interval represents a 10-meter distance for simplicity) and calculate the average steepness (\(S_{avg}\)) and bumpiness (\(B\)) for each segment.
4. Identify the hardest (most difficult) 50-meter segment based on the calculated grades and present its difficulty rating.
